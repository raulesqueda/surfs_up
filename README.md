# Module 9 Challenge

## Overview of the analysis: 

As we develop a code to make an analysis for the surf and ice cream shop businesses, W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, to **determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round**. For this purpose, we took our code and make a new one with the information that W. Any needs for this investment.

## Results: 

First, we need to compare the statistic information we got for the temperature in Oahu, for **the temperature data for June** we got a total of 1,700 temperatures, with a mean of 74.9°F (23.8°C) with a minimum temperature of 64°F (17.7°C) and a maximum of 85°F (29°C).

For **December temperatures**, we got 1,517 temperatures with a mean of 71°F (21.6°C), a minimum temperature of 56°F (13°C) and a maximum of 83°F (28.3°C). As we expect, the island located in the state Hawaii in the northern hemisphere has lower temperatures in December in comparison with June but is a good temperature for this tropical place.

## Summary: 

As expected, the temperature records are higher in June than December, but this helps our analysis to make a recommendation to W. Avy for the surf and ice cream shop business. With this analysis we could say that the two business are sustainable for year-round, but we need more information about the raining, normally, the tropical areas of the Earth has only two seasons with **raining**, this could help to the surf business to have less stock in the rainy season where is common the beaches were closed to the public and the ice-cream business to not produce a considerable quantity of ice-cream. 

Also, we suggest having more data about how many **hurricanes or cyclones** that pass close to the island, this situation could affect the sells of both businesses and we have the possibility of closing during this event.
